  "description": "Python implementation of a bi-objective Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Cash Flow (RCPSP-CF) under interval-valued fuzzy uncertainty. The package implements an extended IVF-TH (Interval-Valued Fuzzy Torabi-Hassini) scalarization approach solved via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) using Pyomo. Features include multi-mode activities, renewable and non-renewable resources, financial constraints (loans, interest, delayed payments), and uncertainty modeling via Normalized Interval-Valued Triangular Fuzzy (NIVTF) numbers.",
